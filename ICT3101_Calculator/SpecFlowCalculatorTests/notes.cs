//Title: Enhance Command Line Calculator for Quality Metric Calculations

/*Description:
 In the quest for maintaining superior software quality, 
     our team of system quality engineers is eager to leverage our command line calculator 
     to perform specialized quality metric calculations. 
     This enhancement includes the ability to compute defect density and the new total number of 
     Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) for subsequent software releases (starting from the 2nd release). 
     Additionally, the Musa Logarithmic model will be integrated to estimate failure intensity and the expected 
     number of failures, both accessible with a single command. 
     This initiative aims to streamline and bolster our quality assessment procedures, 
     making data-driven decisions quicker and more accurate.*/

// 20. User Story Examples for the Features:

/*User Story 1:
Title: Calculate Defect Density
    As a system quality engineer,
    I want to input the number of defects and the size of the module into the command line calculator,
    So that I can quickly determine the defect density for a given software module.

    Acceptance Criteria:

The calculator should accept two inputs: total defects and module size.
    The result should be displayed in defects per size unit (e.g., defects per KLOC).*/
    
/*User Story 2:
Title: Compute Total Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) for Successive Releases
As a system quality engineer,
    I want to enter the SSI of the previous release and the additional SSI for the current release into the command line calculator,
    So that I can get the cumulative total SSI for the software's successive releases.

    Acceptance Criteria:

The calculator should accept two inputs: SSI of the previous release and additional SSI for the current release.
    The result should display the new total SSI.*/
    

/*User Story 3:
Title: Integrate Musa Logarithmic Model for Failure Intensity and Expected Failures
    As a system quality engineer,
    I want to input the necessary parameters into the command line calculator and issue a single command,
    So that I can obtain both the failure intensity and the expected number of failures as per the Musa Logarithmic model.

    Acceptance Criteria:

The calculator should prompt for all necessary parameters for the Musa Logarithmic model.
    With a single command, the calculator should display both the failure intensity and the expected number of failures.
    These user stories provide a detailed perspective on each feature, setting clear expectations and ensuring that 
    the development meets the needs of the system quality engineers.*/

// Given the user stories above, we can group them into two primary features:
//
// Quality Metrics Calculations
//     This feature would include the calculation of defect density and the computation of total 
//     Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) for successive releases.
//
// Musa Logarithmic Model Integration
// This feature would incorporate the Musa Logarithmic model to estimate both 
//     failure intensity and the number of expected failures.
